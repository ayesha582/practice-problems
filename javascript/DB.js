 * The master / slave database replication is a process of copying(syncing) data from a
 * database on one server(the master) to a database on another server(the slaves).
 * The main benefit of this process is to distribute databases to multiple machines,
 * so when the master server has a problem, there is a backup machine with same data available
 * for handling requests without interruption.
