// Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

// As explained above, promises are cleaner way for running asynchronous tasks to look more like synchronous
// and also provide catching mechanism which are not in callbacks.
// Promises are built over callbacks.
// Promises are a very mighty abstraction, allow cleaner and better, functional code with less error-prone boilerplate.
// I would recommend to get the flow of how stuff works and think in terms of promises way.
